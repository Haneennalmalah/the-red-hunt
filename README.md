# The Red Hunt

Welcome to **the-red-hunt** — my personal campaign into the depths of red teaming, penetration testing, and bug bounty hunting.

This repository is not just a collection of notes and projects. It is a story. A journey where every skill forged is a weapon sharpened, every lab or challenge is a battle fought, and every phase of red teaming is a new level to conquer.

## Structure of the Campaign

- `/levels` — Each level represents a phase in my personal learning order. Within each level are daily logs chronicling my battles and breakthroughs.  
- `/weapons` — The arsenal: tools, skills, and techniques I develop along the way.  
- `/bosses` — Major labs, challenges, and machines that serve as boss battles in the campaign.  
- `/logs` or `/journal` — My day-to-day battle reports, reflections, and mindset shifts.

## How to Navigate

Each level folder contains a README outlining the objectives and a series of daily logs named to reflect progress through the level. These logs blend immersive storytelling with technical depth to share not just what I learned but how I grew.

## Purpose

This repo serves as my public proof of growth, skill, and commitment to becoming a skilled red teamer. It’s designed to be both a portfolio for recruiters and a personal archive of my evolving mindset and technical prowess.
