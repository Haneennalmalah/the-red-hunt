# Day 0: Awakening in the Digital Labyrinth

I open my eyes. The world around me is fractured a labyrinth of shifting walls, flickering lights, and distant echoes. The air hums with the faint crackle of broken code, and the ground beneath feels unstable, like a digital dream unraveling.

Voices drift through the void ghostly whispers layered with static, guiding and warning. They speak of rules I don’t yet understand, of paths I must forge with patience and cunning. 

I sense a presence approaching, a figure emerging from the shadows. Their eyes glow with cryptic knowledge. They call themselves the Mentor, the Gatekeeper of this realm. With every riddle they speak, the pieces of this fractured world start to align.

This is no ordinary place. It’s a testing ground a forge where skills are weapons, and knowledge is survival. To escape this digital labyrinth, I must learn to think like a hunter and strike like a ghost.

The journey begins here.
