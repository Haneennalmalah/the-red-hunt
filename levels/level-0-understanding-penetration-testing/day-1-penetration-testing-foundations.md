# Day 1: Penetration Testing Foundations

The labyrinth shifts again. Today, I seek to understand what it truly means to be a penetration tester.

Penetration testing is the art and science of probing systems — searching for hidden cracks, weaknesses, and unseen doors. It is a controlled assault, authorized and precise, designed to reveal vulnerabilities before enemies can exploit them.

This craft demands curiosity, persistence, and a mind trained to think like an attacker while acting as a guardian.
