# Day 3: Faces of the Hunt — Understanding the Trials Ahead

The labyrinth’s walls pulse with cryptic symbols, each one a different path, a different challenge. To move forward, I must understand the many faces of the hunt — the different forms penetration testing takes.

The Mentor’s voice grows clearer:  
“There are many roles in this fight. Each requires a unique skill set, a different mindset. To join the Red Team, you must choose your path wisely.”

## The Trials of Penetration Testing

- **Black Box:** The unseen attacker. No prior knowledge. Must rely on intuition, reconnaissance, and guesswork.  
- **White Box:** The insider’s role. Full knowledge of the system, focusing on deep code analysis and logic flaws.  
- **Gray Box:** The middle ground. Partial knowledge, blending stealth with informed attacks.  

Each trial tests different strengths — patience, creativity, technical mastery. None are easy. All demand respect for boundaries and ethics.

## The Role I Must Choose

To earn my place, I will need to face these trials — learning how to uncover secrets hidden in the dark, understanding systems from both outside and within.

The path is daunting, but the promise of mastery pulls me forward. I must train relentlessly, sharpen every tool in my arsenal, and remain vigilant.

*The hunt is not a single path — it is a convergence of many. To survive, I must become adaptable, relentless, and wise.*
