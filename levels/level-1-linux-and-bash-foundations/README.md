# Level 1: Linux and Bash Foundations

Welcome to Level 1 of **The Red Hunt**.

To become a true Red Teamer, I must master the environment I‚Äôll be hacking within ‚Äî and that begins with understanding **Linux**. This level marks my initiation into the world of systems, shells, and scripts.

Here, I will forge the following weapons:
- Confidence navigating Linux terminals  
- Proficiency in Bash scripting  
- Understanding core OS components (users, permissions, processes)  
- The ability to set up servers and interpret their behavior  

Each day will be a battle against unfamiliar syntax, strange command flags, and frustrating permission errors. But every victory brings me closer to becoming a Red Hunter worthy of the shadows.
