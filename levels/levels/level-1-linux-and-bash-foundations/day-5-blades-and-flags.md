# Day 5: Blades and Flags  
*“A command is only as sharp as the flag you wield with it.”*

---

The labyrinth didn’t stay still for long.

As soon as I touched the terminal again, the environment shifted. The walls pulsed — not physically, but like a current of data surged through them, waiting for a command. Waiting for *me*.

The same blinking prompt greeted me:
root@unknown:~#

Only this time, I felt less like an intruder... and more like a student. The system whispered again — no voices, no words, but suggestions. Strings. Commands. Swords.

I had to learn how to slice.

## ⚔️ What I Learned Today

### 🔹 Command Structure

I noticed a pattern in the way the system reacted to input. It was always:
command -option argument


Like a spell formula. You chant it right, you get what you want. You mess it up, it backfires or vanishes.

Examples:
- `ls -l /etc` → List contents of `/etc` with details
- `cat /etc/passwd` → Display contents of a file
- `mkdir secrets` → Make a new directory

### 🔸 The Weapon Rack: Core Linux Commands

I trained with these blades today — all sharp, some trickier than others:

| Command       | Use |
|---------------|-----|
| `ls`          | Lists files and directories  
| `cd`          | Move between directories  
| `pwd`         | Shows your current path  
| `mkdir`       | Creates a directory  
| `touch`       | Creates an empty file  
| `cp`          | Copies files  
| `mv`          | Moves or renames files  
| `rm`          | Removes (deletes) files  
| `rmdir`       | Removes empty directories  
| `cat`         | Displays file contents  
| `man`         | Pulls up manual pages — ancient scrolls  
| `clear`       | Clears the terminal (and the mind)  

> Flags like `-r`, `-f`, `-l`, and `-a` are what define your finesse with each command.  
> Without them, you’re swinging blindly.

### 🧠 Reflections

- A command without a flag is like a blade without a handle.
- I felt the system *respond* to precision. Syntax isn't just structure here — it's power.
- `man` pages feel like encrypted books from a forgotten age. I’ll have to revisit them again and again.

## 🧩 Lore Fragment

> *"Every tool here is a weapon. But not every wielder is worthy. Until your flags are fluent and your commands exact, the gate remains closed."*

I looked around. The gate was there now — a sealed digital barrier behind the terminal. Glyphs of commands scrolled across its surface.

To pass, I’ll need more than `ls` and `cd`. I’ll need fluency.
